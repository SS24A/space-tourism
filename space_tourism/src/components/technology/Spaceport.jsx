                    A spaceport or cosmodrome is a site for launching (or
                    receiving) spacecraft, by analogy to the seaport for ships
                    or airport for aircraft. Based in the famous Cape Canaveral,
                    our spaceport is ideally situated to take advantage of the
                    Earthâ€™s rotation for launch.
